Created a bash script that sends updated versions out to the live servers

	-WebServer will send their updated versions to the WebServerVersion folder in the VersionControl folder
	-APIVersion sends theirs to the APIVersion directory
	-Database sends theirs to the DatabaseVersion directory

	-SCPMultiTransferTest.sh asks for 3 arguments:
		*$1 refers to the name of the WebServer Version
		*$2 refers to the name of the APIServer Version
		*$3 refers to the name of the Database Version
		*if no arguments are entered, returns an error message

	-All change logs sent in from the other servers will be stored in their respective folders in the /IT490/ChangeLogs

Created 6 new PHP scripts:
	- VerTWeb.php - sends message and runs toWebLive.sh
	- VerTWebTest.php - sends message and runs toWebTest.sh
	- VerTAPI.php - sends message and runs toAPILive.sh
	- VerTAPItest.php - sends message and runs toAPITest.sh
	- VerTDB.php - sends message and runs toDBLive.sh
	- VerTDBtest.php - sends message and runs toDBTest.sh

Added 6 new bash scripts that split the bulk workload of the SCPTransfer.sh script
	- toAPILive.sh - pushes the new API version to the Live API server
	- toAPITest.sh - pushes the new API version to the Test API server
	- toWebLive.sh - pushes the new Web version to the Live Web server
	- toWebTest.sh - pushes the new Web version to the Test Web server
	- toDBLive.sh - pushes the new database version to the Live Database server
	- toDBTest.sh - pushes the new database version to the Test Database server

Added new PHP scripts that utilizes the above scripts to automatically send and install the latest versions onto the Test or Live servers.
	- automatedReceive opens a channel and waits for an input from either the dev or the QA servers
	- upon receiving a message and a version from either server source, this script will read the function and determine the destination
	- it then runs one of the scripts mentioned above
	- this should also allow the system to process multiple messages and send all the proper versions to the proper places
	

Also deleted all the preset queues so that duplicate queue instances won't happen and will not interfere with the application's goals
